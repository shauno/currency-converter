Mukuru Practical Test

Setup
---

* Clone the repository

* Download and install all PHP dependencies (you need composer installed, which is outside the scope of this document)

        `$ composer install`

* Create a host in your web server pointing to the `./public/` directory. This is tested with Apache, but should work
with anything that can implement the `./public/.htaccess` rules
